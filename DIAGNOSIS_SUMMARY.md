# Comprehensive Testing and Diagnosis Summary

## Issues Identified

### 1. Profile Retrieval Returns Empty Object
- **Symptom**: `GET /profile` returns `profile: {}` even after successful profile update
- **Root Cause**: Profile is being saved but not retrieved correctly
- **Location**: `backend/routes/profile.js:50` returns `userProfile?.profile_json || {}`
- **Impact**: Mission generation fails because it can't find profile data

### 2. Mission Generation Fails
- **Symptom**: Returns "User profile not found" even after profile update succeeds
- **Root Cause**: Mission service checks for profile data but profile_json is empty
- **Location**: `backend/services/mission.service.js:50-54`
- **Impact**: Users cannot generate personalized missions

## Fixes Applied

1. ✅ Added comprehensive logging in `ProfileService.updateProfile()` and `getProfile()`
2. ✅ Added debug logging in `MockDatabaseService.getUserProfile()`, `createUserProfile()`, `updateUserProfile()`
3. ✅ Updated `MissionService.generateMissions()` with better profile validation
4. ✅ Fixed async handling in `UsersRepo.getUserProfile()` methods
5. ✅ Updated profile service to handle `profile_json` payload correctly

## Remaining Issues

### Critical: Profile Not Persisting
The profile update endpoint returns success, but subsequent GET requests return empty profile.
This suggests:
- Profile is being saved in `updateProfile()` 
- But `getProfile()` retrieves null or empty profile_json
- Need to check backend terminal logs for debug output showing what's happening

## Next Steps

1. **Check Backend Terminal Logs**: Look for `[MockDB]` and `ProfileService` log messages
2. **Verify Profile Storage**: Confirm profile is actually being saved to `user_profiles` array
3. **Check User ID Consistency**: Ensure same user ID is used for save and retrieve
4. **Test Profile Round-Trip**: Create isolated test that saves and immediately retrieves

## Test Results

✅ **Passing Tests**:
- Health endpoint
- Profile update (returns 200, but data not persisting)
- Get missions with coin_reward field
- Exclusive offers JSON

❌ **Failing Tests**:
- Profile retrieval (empty profile returned)
- Mission generation (profile not found)

⚠️ **Warnings**:
- Profile fields missing in GET response

## Debug Commands

To see backend logs:
```bash
# Check if backend is running
curl http://localhost:3001/api/health

# Run comprehensive test
node scripts/test-comprehensive-validation.mjs
```

## Log Locations

Backend logs should show:
- `[MockDB]` prefix: Database operations
- `ProfileService.` prefix: Profile service operations  
- `generateMissions` prefix: Mission generation operations

Check backend terminal output for these logs to diagnose the persistence issue.
