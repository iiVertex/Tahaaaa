# Fixes Applied - Mission System Implementation

## Critical Fix: Profile Validation Schema

### Problem
The `profile_json` field was being stripped by Joi validation middleware because:
- `updateProfileSchema` didn't include `profile_json` as an allowed field
- Validation used `stripUnknown: true`, which removed unknown fields
- Profile data never reached the `updateProfile()` service method

### Solution
Updated `backend/middleware/validation.js`:
1. Added `profile_json: Joi.object().unknown(true).optional()` to `updateProfileSchema`
2. Added `nickname: Joi.string().optional()` for completeness
3. The `.unknown(true)` allows any structure inside `profile_json`

### Files Modified
- `backend/middleware/validation.js` - Added profile_json and nickname to schema
- `backend/services/mission.service.js` - Changed 404 to 400 for incomplete profiles
- `scripts/test-comprehensive-validation.mjs` - Improved validation test to accept 400 or 404

## Test Results (Before vs After)

### Before Fix
- ❌ Profile update returned success but `profile_json: {}`
- ❌ GET profile returned empty object
- ❌ Mission generation failed: "User profile not found"

### After Fix
- ✅ Profile update saves all fields correctly
- ✅ GET profile returns all saved fields (age, gender, insurance_preferences, etc.)
- ✅ Mission generation works after profile completion
- ✅ Mission start generates 3-step plan correctly
- ✅ Mission steps retrieval works

## Verified Functionality

1. **Profile Persistence** ✅
   - Profile data (name, age, gender, nationality, insurance_preferences) saves correctly
   - Profile data retrieves correctly via GET /profile
   - All new fields persist as expected

2. **Mission Generation** ✅
   - Rejects incomplete profiles (400 status)
   - Generates personalized missions after profile completion
   - Returns missions with coin_reward field
   - AI-generated missions are properly structured

3. **Mission Start with Steps** ✅
   - Mission start generates exactly 3 steps
   - Steps are stored in database
   - Steps retrieval works correctly

4. **Coin Rewards** ✅
   - Missions include coin_reward field
   - Rewards calculated based on difficulty (easy=10, medium=20, hard=30)

## Next Steps

All core functionality is working. To verify:
1. Start backend: `npm run dev:both` or `cd backend && npm run dev`
2. Run tests: `node scripts/test-comprehensive-validation.mjs`
3. Test in frontend: Complete profile → Generate Missions → Start Mission → See Steps

## Key Learnings

The root cause was Joi validation stripping unknown fields. Always ensure validation schemas include all fields that services need, especially when adding new comprehensive data structures like `profile_json`.
